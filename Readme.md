## Description: 
 
##### The goal is to explore the dataset a bit, get some insights about important attributes of survivors and build an end-to-  end machine learning model which predicts the survival of passengers on board the Titanic.
 
##### We first explore the data, and then try to predict the survival odds.
##### The main function implements an end-to-end classification pipeline including mainly a data EDA and prediction parts.

## Libraries: 
##### numpy
##### sklearn
